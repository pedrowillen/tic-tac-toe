## How It Works

The Tic-Tac-Toe game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how each part of the project works:

### HTML

The HTML file structures the game board and the interface. It includes:

- A 3x3 grid for the Tic-Tac-Toe board.
- Status display to show the current player's turn and the game result.
- A reset button to start a new game.

### CSS

The CSS file styles the game to make it visually appealing. Key styles include:

- Flexbox layout for centering the game board.
- Styling for the game cells to make them interactive.
- Responsive design to ensure the game looks good on different devices.

### JavaScript

The JavaScript file contains the game logic, including:

- Initializing the game board and setting the initial state.
- Handling player moves and updating the game state.
- Checking for win conditions and handling game over scenarios.
- Allowing players to reset the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Provides the structure for the game interface.
